*Immunization Economics is an information-sharing online platform. It connects thousands dedicated to the field of study relating to the cost, financing, sustainability, efficiency, and value of immunizations throughout the world. It does so through publications on the web platform, routine newsletter, social media outreach, and in-person convenings.*
  
*The site was originally created in 2015 as part of the EPIC project with funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. With new stakeholders and interests from the community, the platform has evolved into an audience-facing platform that it is today, making information readily used. The aim of the platform is to act as a resource for organizations and individuals involved in the field of immunization economics, including experts and policy-makers, and to create a connected global community for sharing resources, ideas, information, and research to aid in the advancement of the field.*

## Podcasts: series

[The Jab](https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2021/02/22/the-jab-a-new-podcast-from-the-economist)    
"The Jab from" from Economist Radio is a new podcast reporting from the sharp end of the vaccination race. The Economist’s science and data teams, a global network of correspondents, and interviews with key players bring a unique perspective and depth of insight to the challenge of a generation.

Each episode tackles a different theme along the supply chain — from the innovations that make the new vaccines possible and the politics of distribution, to the drivers of vaccine hesitancy.
  
## Podcasts: single episodes

[Patent pools for generic drugs](https://voxeu.org/vox-talks/patent-pools-generic-drugs). VoxTalks. 19 February 2021.  
Diffusion of new drugs is painfully slow in low-income countries. Mark Schankerman tells Tim Phillips about how patent pools accelerate the process, and how we could still do a better job of licensing life-saving medicines.

[Equitable Vaccine Rollout, Policy Support Key to Financial Stability](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Podcasts/All-Podcasts/2021/01/26/gfsr-update). IMF Podcasts. 27 January 2021.  
Many things can happen within the global financial system to disrupt financial stability, and the pandemic is testing most of them. Fabio Natalucci heads the IMF's Global Financial Stability Report, which analyses trends in the world economy and looks for potential vulnerabilities. The latest update identifies the uneven distribution of vaccines across the globe as one of those vulnerabilities, especially for frontier market economies. In this podcast, Natalucci says while the vaccine rollout has boosted hopes of a recovery this year, there are still difficult times ahead.

[Michael Kremer: Investing in Vaccines Now Would Buy Time, Save $Billions](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Podcasts/All-Podcasts/2020/10/09/michael-kremer). IMF Podcasts. 9 October 2020.  
In the early 2000s, Nobel Laureate, Michael Kremer helped develop the design of advance market commitment models (AMCs). They were used to incentivize the private sector to work on issues of relevance for the developing world by pledging that if they developed an appropriate vaccine, funds would be available for those countries to purchase it. The approach resulted in billions of dollars being devoted to pneumococcal vaccines for strains common in developing countries, saving hundreds of thousands of lives. Kremer's latest research focuses on how to expedite the production and distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines immediately following successful medical trials. In this podcast, Kremer says at-risk investment into vaccine manufacturing capacity before clinical approval would advance vaccine distribution by 6 months or more.

#### **Development / production / market design**

Ahuja, A., et al. (2021)[Preparing for a Pandemic: Accelerating Vaccine Availability](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/preparing-for-a-pandemic-accelerating-vaccine-availability/). *BFI Working Paper*, NO. 2021-08.  
(30 January 2021) Vaccinating the world’s population quickly in a pandemic has enormous health and economic benefits. We analyze the problem faced by governments in determining the scale and structure of procurement for vaccines. We analyze alternative approaches to procurement, arguing that buyers should directly fund manufacturing capacity and shoulder most of the risk of failure, while maintaining some direct incentives for speed. We analyzed the optimal portfolio of vaccine investments for countries with different characteristics as well as the implications for international cooperation. Our analysis, considered in light of the experience of 2020, suggests lessons for future pandemics.

Kremer, M., Snyder, C.M. (2020). [Strengthening Incentives for Vaccine Development](https://www.nber.org/reporter/2020number4/strengthening-incentives-vaccine-development). *NBER The Reporter*, 4.    
(December 2020) Along with improvements in sanitation and nutrition, vaccines have been given credit for substantial reductions in illness and death. Yet the level of research activity devoted to developing new vaccines, at least prior to COVID-19, raises concerns about whether the incentives to develop vaccines are commensurate with the benefits derived from them. Figure 1 shows counts of Phase 3 clinical trials registered annually from 2006 to 2019 by the National Institutes of Health. The number of vaccine trials (left scale), averaging about 75 per year for infectious diseases, is overshadowed by drug trials (right scale), averaging about 1,950 per year. Annual trials for infectious-disease vaccines trend sharply downward compared with the relatively constant number for drugs and for cancer vaccines.

#### **Economic impact**

Çakmaklı, C., et al. (2021). [The Economic Case for Global Vaccinations: An Epidemiological Model with International Production Networks](https://www.nber.org/papers/w28395). *NBER Working Paper*, w28395.  
(January 2021) COVID-19 pandemic had a devastating effect on both lives and livelihoods in 2020. The arrival of effective vaccines can be a major game changer. However, vaccines are in short supply as of early 2021 and most of them are reserved for the advanced economies. We show that the global GDP loss of not inoculating all the countries, relative to a counterfactual of global vaccinations, is higher than the cost of manufacturing and distributing vaccines globally. We use an economic-epidemiological framework that combines a SIR model with international production and trade networks. Based on this framework, we estimate the costs for 65 countries and 35 sectors. Our estimates suggest that up to 49 percent of the global economic costs of the pandemic in 2021 are borne by the advanced economies even if they achieve universal vaccination in their own countries.  
  
Hafner, M., et al.(2020). [COVID-19 and the cost of vaccine nationalism](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA769-1.html). *RAND Corporation Research Reports, RR-A769-1.*  
Experience shows that, in response to pandemics, national governments tend to follow their own interests instead of pursuing a more globally coordinated approach. This nationalistic behaviour could have negative consequences on how well the COVID-19 global pandemic is managed and contained. A situation in which countries push to get first access to a supply of vaccines, potentially hoarding key components for vaccine production, has been commonly referred to as 'vaccine nationalism'. This report examines how the management of the COVID-19 crisis may be affected by vaccine nationalism and what the associated economic cost would be of inequitable access to vaccines across countries.
