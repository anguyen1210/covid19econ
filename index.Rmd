There is seemingly infinite amounts of information about the different ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting the global economy. The purpose of this site is to share some of the resources I have found most useful for helping me to understand the short- and long-term impacts the virus is having on the global economy. The selection is personal, not comprehensive, and very much biased towards my own interests, which are largely focused on international economics and growth, vaccine procurement and distribution, and efforts to prevent the pandemic from accelerating inequalities on international level. Contact details are at the bottom of the page; comments and suggestions are most welcome.  

  
## Collections / Platforms  
  
[VoxEU & CEPR Covid-19](https://voxeu.org/pages/covid-19-page)    
The CEPR research network started publishing on this topic early, and their site has a "real-time" COVID Economics journal, discussion papers, articles and multimedia covering every imaginable aspect of the COVID-19 response. There's no dedicated mailing list or feed for the moment, but new content is added more or less on a regular basis.
  
[NBER Studies related to COVID-19](https://www.nber.org/nber-studies-related-covid-19-pandemic-topic-area)  
NBER has collected all of their working papers on pandemic-related research and grouped them by different topic areas. As per usual, these are all open-access and not-yet peer-reviewed.    
  
[CESifo Economic Research on COVID-19](https://www.cesifo.org/en/economic-research-on-covid-19)  
The latest working papers on all things COVID-19 from the CESifo research network. Very current and organized chronologically.  
    
[C19 Economics](https://c19economics.org/)  
The C19 platform is sponsored by a group of partners coming  more from the health side than the purely economic side. Here, the focus is really on sharing information (academic papers, webinars, discussion forums) specifically on health economics, with a focus towards low- and middle-income countries. Helpfully, they do have a newsletter that you can sign up for, though I've yet to receive much, if anything.    

  
## Podcasts: Series  
  
[Pandemic Economics](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/podcast/pandemic-economics/)    

"Insights from top economists to help you navigate the economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis. Hosts Tess Vigeland and Eduardo Porter talk to University of Chicago economists about their research, revealing important new ways to make sense of this moment. Economics is at the heart of crucial decisions about how we confront the COVID-19 crisis. Topics range from global trade to the changing meaning of work. Pandemic Economics is produced by the Becker Friedman Institute and Stitcher and is part of the University of Chicago podcast network. Production and original music in this series is by Story Mechanics."

(12 Nov. 2020) The Harvard Global Health Institute put together an [online course about COVID-19](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDSYr_mbXj9VtUDUNPmMO6VnkagS_YnbP) to explore a range of issues and questions related to the pandemic. There are 26 episodes, each covering different topics. I haven't gone through them all, but this episode on the economic impacts of COVID-19 was great, particularly for the nice overview of the impact and response to the virus in the U.S (Karen Dynan), as well as the work the IMF has been doing to better understand the global impact (Gita Gopinath). as well as the episodes on Global Governance and the WHO and Global Health, Global South quite informative as well.
